C++ code running on an Arduino Nano to retrieve strain gauge, wind vane, and anemometer data for the purposes of testing a patented solar panel structure. Python script takes in this data over serial on a laptop, prints sensor readings every three seconds, and pipes the data to a CSV file once the script is terminated.
